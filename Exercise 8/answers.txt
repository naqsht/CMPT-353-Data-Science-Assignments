1. Random Forest and KNN models gave very similar results. However, Random Forest Classifier was
the best option for me, because it gave best results, consistently. We can choose the number of 
estimators and see which one works best. For me, n_estimators=150 turned out to be the best option.

2. Yes, the model seems to make reasonable mistakes while predicting. In addition to the given features, Average Temperature 
for each month is a feature which can improve the prediction results. The reason being that, Min and Max temperature give us
the extreme values, while Average Temperature tends to give an overall picture, which might be helpful.
