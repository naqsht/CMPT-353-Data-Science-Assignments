1. The Square Root transformation got me the closest to satisfying assumptions of a T-test.
2. I could reject the null hypothesis, because the initial Student T-Test has a p-values < 0.05.
We do not obtain a normal distribution in that case.
3. In my case, Square Root data did a better job at it.
4. From the data, we can see that mean of comments for weekdays is higher than the same for weekends. But we also need to consider that
we have more data for weekdays as compared to weekends, because we have 5 weekdays and 2 weekends in every week.
So, a concrete conclusion about this cannot be drawn from the data given.
