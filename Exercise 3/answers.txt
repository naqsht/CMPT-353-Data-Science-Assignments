1. While smoothing CPU temperature, I think the results I got with Kalman smoothing were better than LOESS smoothing, 
the reason being that Kalman smoothing was more sensitive to the extreme values, while LOESS smoothing was not. 
Whenever there was an outlier, the value in Kalman filtering changed significantly, while in LOESS smoothing, similar changes are not visible.
So, Kalman smoothens the data while still providing the sensitive information (here, ouliers), unlike LOESS smoothing.

2. Data like timestamp, course and speed can also be used to make better predictions about the next latitude and longitude. We can take differences between timestamps
and multiple that by the speed for that respective time period to make a prediction about the distance travelled. That is, Speed * (Difference between timestamps).
However (just to be completely accurate), I believe that timestamps with the least difference should be considered, so that the direction of travel doesn't alter the prediction much.
