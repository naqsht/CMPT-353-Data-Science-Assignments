1. I found NumPy to be easier to work with as compared to Pandas. The reason for this was that NumPy had a much simpler syntax,
but to do the same task in Pandas, the syntax was long and also a bit more complex. The date_to_month function was easier for NumPy but was hard to figure out for Pandas.
The NumPy code is easier to read, due to its simpler syntax.

2. The running times for the two functions were:
pivot_months_loops: 555 ms +- 50 ms per loop, 1 loop
pivot_months_pandas: 20.2 ms +- 1.12 ms per loop, 10 loops

The reason that Pandas ran faster was that it uses the C string equivalent in Python, Numpy, which is faster.
